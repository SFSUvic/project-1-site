                    <p> When creating designs, I usually like to start by planning what sort of message I'm trying to convey. Then, I test various layouts, type settings, image adjustments, and so on, to see what could help convey the message. Along
                              the way, I may discover something I hadn't planned at all works well, so I implement such cases into whatever I had planned, or I may even alter my plan depending what type of change it is. Mostly, I try to focus my
                              designs on staying organized and clean, unless of course the message I try to convery calls for something else. I'm still trying to learn new techniques and gather new skills, but hopefully I can use my school experience
                              to work towards my career.
